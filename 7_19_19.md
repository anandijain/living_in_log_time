1. E(X) = 
	- now that i understand the structure and math behind anodes, i feel comfortable deleting a lot of the garbage edits i made to make anodes work on my stuff and reverting back to the original anode code.
		a. this is good because then it will be compatible with the original anode stuff and i can use trainer.py, config.json, and main_experiment.py

2. 
	- 10 am: i have reviewed the entire Anode repo
	- 11 am: thought experiment with yunchong about recursively (merge-sort like) ode solving to better paralellize NODEs / possibly improve performance in cases where t=0 data is noisy.
	- 12 pm: got lunch, thought experiment for diff'able Q functions in RL
	- 1 pm: read thru https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04860.pdf 'increasing the action gap for rl'. 
	- 2 pm: neural jump reading, hybrid systems
	- 3 pm: continuous normalizing flows
	- 4 pm:
